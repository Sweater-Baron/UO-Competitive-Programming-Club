Hi we are trying to start a Compeititve Programming Club to help computer science students who refuse to
be mediocre programmer sharpen their coding skills on solving programming puzzles therefore they can land 
good jobs in their dream companies and fully exploit their talent. 

A players want to be A players. I want to invite you to our early adopters' meeting @Deschutes $(SOMETIME). 
In that meeting we will be covering "Network Flow Algorithm", which is frequently asked in the interviews but 
not covered by our school.  Since we are trying to limit the number of people to under 30, if you can give 
me a confirmation of attending I would like to preserve your spot for you.
