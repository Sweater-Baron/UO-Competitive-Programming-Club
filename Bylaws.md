***[Elections/Appointments: The selection process below is just a sample. You can either adapt the process below to your group’s style, or just replace it with your group’s entirely new process. You don’t have to use a voting system, but you should implement a leadership selection process that is both fair and appropriate for your group in particular. For example, if your group is more specific-skill-focused, you may have the outgoing leadership appoint the next leader directly after interviewing candidates based on their aptitude for the particular role to be filled.]***  
### Elections & General Group Voting
1. Elections will be announced via the club email or web page, and must be announced at at least one regular meeting held before the election process takes place.

Through unanimous decision of the Executive Board, or by popular vote of the active membership, the member will assume the position immediately.

***[Transitioning: It is critical that you clearly state who is responsible for training/preparing new group leaders to transition into their roles. This can be the most difficult part of the whole leadership process for many incoming leaders.]***

2. Summer Meetings may be organized based on the availability and interest of the group members.

***[Grievances & Complaints: More likely than not your group won’t have any issues that will need this kind of process. Just in case though, it’s good to have it all written down. You can adapt parts of this process to suit your group, but the final part about appeal / intervention by the ASUO Executive / Programs Administrator is required.]***  
### Grievances & Complaints
1. The internal organization mediation process for resolving grievances against or between officers, staff, or Organization members will start with the filing of a formal written complaint with the group President/Director (or Co-Director if the President/Director is the focus of the grievance) describing the grievances and any concerns that go with it. Complaints should mention specific concerns for the group, as well as suggestions for proper relief and steps that have already been taken.

3. All equipment and materials purchased in whole or part with Incidental Fees allocations shall be returned to the ASUO Executive.

***[Amendment: Bylaws should be able to change year-to-year as needed by the growth and development of the student org. You can make this process as difficult as you want, but you may appreciate loosening the requirements a bit to be able to make changes when necessary.]***
